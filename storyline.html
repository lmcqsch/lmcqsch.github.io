			An outbreak of canine influenza spreads throughout <b>Japan</b> including the city of <b>Megasaki</b> with the risk of becoming contagious to humans. 
			The city's authoritarian mayor, <b>Kenji Kobayashi</b>, endorses an official decree banishing all dogs to <b>Trash Island</b>, which is immediately approved despite the insistence of <b>Professor Watanabe</b>, <b>Kobayashi</b>'s political oponent, who states he is close to creating a cure. 
			The first deported canine is a white and black-spotted dog named <b>Spots Kobayashi</b>, who served as the bodyguard dog of 12-year-old orphan <b><b>Atari</b> Kobayashi</b>, the mayor's distant nephew and ward.

			Six months later, <b>Atari</b> hijacks a plane and flies it to <b>Trash Island</b> (nicknamed "<b>Isle of Dogs</b>") to search for <b>Spots</b>. 
			After crash-landing, <b>Atari</b> is rescued by a dog pack ostensibly led by an all-black canine named <b>Chief</b>, a lifelong stray. 
			They then fend off a rescue team sent by <b>Kobayashi</b> to retrieve <b>Atari</b>. <b>Atari</b> decides to continue his search for <b>Spots</b>, and the pack decides to help him. 
			<b>Chief</b> initially declines, but is then convinced by <b>Nutmeg</b>, a female ex-show dog, to help the boy out of obligation. 
			The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs <b>Jupiter</b> and <b>Oracle</b>, who surmise that <b>Spots</b> might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be cannibals.

			Meanwhile, <b>Watanabe</b> finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to <b>Kobayashi</b>, who only dismisses him. 
			The professor objects, only to be put under house arrest and killed by a piece of poisoned sushi by order of the mayor's hatchet man, <b>Major Domo</b>. 
			<b>Tracy Walker</b>, an American exchange student and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. 
			<b>Kobayashi</b> and his political party are revealed to be actually responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs as <b>Kobayashi</b>'s cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1000 years ago, who were foiled by a child samurai resembling <b>Atari</b>.

			During their journey, <b>Chief</b> and <b>Atari</b> are separated from the others. <b>Atari</b> gives <b>Chief</b> a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat revealing his striking resemblance to <b>Spots</b>. 
			The two bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, and are saved by <b>Spots</b> and the dog tribe from another rescue team. 
			<b>Spots</b> confirms that he is <b>Chief</b>'s older brother and that he was rescued by the tribe, who were test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a tsunami. 
			<b>Spots</b> requests for <b>Atari</b> to transfer his protection duties to <b>Chief</b>, and 
			while <b>Chief</b> is initially hesitant, but both he and <b>Atari</b> accept, and bodyguard duties are officially transferred to <b>Chief</b>. 
			An owl later brings word that <b>Kobayashi</b> has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas.

			<b>Tracy</b> confronts <b>Watanabe</b>'s closest colleague <b>Yoko Ono</b>, who confirms <b>Tracy</b>'s conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of serum. 
			At his re-election ceremony, <b>Kobayashi</b> prepares to give the extermination order when <b>Tracy</b> presents her evidence of his corruption. 
			<b>Kobayashi</b> proceeds to deport <b>Tracy</b>, but before he could, <b>Atari</b> and the dogs arrive. 
			They confirm the serum works by testing it on </b>Chief</b> and curing him. 
			<b>Atari</b> addresses the crowd and recites a haiku (Japanese poem) he wrote and dedicated to <b>Kobayashi</b>, reviving the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans. 
			Touched by <b>Atari</b>'s words, <b>Kobayashi</b> officially rescinds the dog ban. 
			Enraged, <b>Major Domo</b> yells at <b>Mayor Kobayashi</b> for breaking the Mayor's campaign promise and tries to initiate the extermination himself, but thanks to <b>Spots</b> and the activists, <b>Domo</b>'s plans are thwarted. 
			<b>Atari</b> and Spots become gravely injured during the struggle and are taken to a hospital, where <b>Kobayashi</b> donates one of his kidneys to save his nephew. 
			It is later revealed that while <b>Kobayashi</b> did win the election, he won't hold office because he was caught in a scandal. 
			Therefore, all mayoral powers and authorities will transfer his next-in-line, <b>Atari</b>.

			One month later, <b>Atari</b> officially becomes the new mayor of <b>Megasaki</b>, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while <b>Kobayashi</b> and his propagandists and co-conspirators are sent to jail for political corruption, also doing community service, paying fines of no less than ¥250,000 and possibly facing a death sentence. 
			<b>Spots</b> (recovering from his injuries) has had a statue erected in his honor, and resumes raising his litter with <b>Peppermint</b> under the care of a monk at a Shinto temple.
